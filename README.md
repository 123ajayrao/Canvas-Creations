# Canvas Creations  - Hacktoberfest 2020

Welcome to this years creative challenge for Hacktoberfest ([What is Hacktoberfest?](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/coding_challenge-31/blob/master/README.md#what-is-hacktoberfest)) A project with beginners and aspiring developers in mind, utilizing the HTML Canvas element to create and showcase works of art.

Everyone is encouraged to participate, regardless of your skill level. This is a practice project and should be considered a playground.

##### What is Canvas
> `<canvas>` is an HTML element which can be used to draw graphics via scripting (usually JavaScript). This can, for instance, be used to draw graphs, combine photos, or create simple (and not so simple) animations. 

## Project Brief
TBD

## Getting Started
> If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at our [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). This repo has everything you need to learn about open-source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR.
> Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

> **All discussions around this event can now be had in our #hacktoberfest-2020 channel on Discord!**

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.
2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer
3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates)

    - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Canvas-Creations.git`
    - `git pull upstream master`
    - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Create a folder in `/art/` with your Github handle, eg. `/art/myname/`
5. Create your canvas artwork contained within the folder we made in the previous step
6. Link your name in the index.html file

7. Create a branch for your task and complete the task
8. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to insure we still have the latest code.
    - `git pull upstream master`
9. Commit and push the code to your fork
10. Create a pull request to have the changes merged from your fork into the origin
11. [Tweet about making your first Hacktoberfest pull request](https://ctt.ac/6TNVS)
